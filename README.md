# FacadeUI

FacadeUI is meant to be a minimalist immediate mode GUI library in C++, designed for use in games, with an absolute minimum of dependencies to ensure it is as portable and unintrusive as possible.

## TODO

* Finish creating unit tests and widgets to satisfy them. The list of widgets to be added can be found in src/facade.h as commented out #include directives.
* Develop the renderer systems and supply default renderers for use with each widget.
* Start writing demos, documentation, and examples for each widget.
